# svelte-server-client-rendering
Example of server-side and client-side rendering in Svelte.
 
```javascript
npm run build
npm start
```

## How it works
A primitive server is written in the [index.js](index.js) file. This server returns `html` rendered by the
[Server.svelte](Server.svelte) for the root `/` URL, and assumes static files are
requested from the [public](public) directory for any other URL.

The `html` generated by the [Server.svelte](Server.svelte) loads the `client.js` file. This client's script is
generated by the [Client.svelte](Client.svelte) during building process. This
script does client-side rendering.

The static `html` is also created during building process by the
[Static.svelte](Static.svelte).
